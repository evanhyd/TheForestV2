# TheForestV2
Unique features: 
Change player skins + clothes, 
invisible, teleport outside of the game boundary (up to unity engine's limits), 
impersonate and whiper in chat, instant kill + ignite other players, 
guarantee one click instant build,
spawn death bunny to crash the server.


The DLL itself is a source code, because the game engine is Unity lol.
